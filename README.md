## Description

Refactoring code for a fictional company (Horiseon)

This project is a refactoring of existing code to meet accessibility standards without changing the exact same look and feel of the website. The new source code includes semantic HTML, alt text for images as well as clean html and css files.

Assistive technology should be able to easily navigate the page in its current format with a navigation bar, a list of articles and an aside with additional information about the company.

I did not include alt text for the "hero" background image because I did not feel that it contributed to the content of the page and would be an unnecessary distraction for the user, but 'aria-label' could be added to the .hero element in the stylesheet if that is desired.

## Installation
